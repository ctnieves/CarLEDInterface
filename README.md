Car LED Interface
==========
This is an Arduino project used to interface with LED strips using 4 buttons installed in the car along with a 3rd party LED device to which IR commands are relayed in order to maintain synced colors between the 3rd party device and the LED strips.  

The IRDump project is used for dumping an IRCode struct over serial for received IR commands/codes.
